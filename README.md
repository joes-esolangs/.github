Hi im [Joe](https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Joe).

I like creating cool (and not cool) esolangs that usually have something to do with math.

(I also think esolangs are the future of programming)

Here are the ones I've made so far:

* [Legend](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Legend)
* [E𝄪](https://esolangs.org/wiki/E%F0%9D%84%AA)
* [Smalc](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Smalc)

others are in the making :)
